      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>YioRzHe-HotaaRu</strong>, a hobbyist developer with a passion for <strong>coding fun projects</strong> and creating <strong>2D games</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started coding because I wanted to bring my game ideas to life. Since then, I've fallen in love with building small tools, experimenting with engines like <strong>Godot</strong>, and playing around with bunch of open-source projects.

        <li><strong>2D Game Development</strong> – Designing mechanics, pixel art, and small indie-style games.</li>
        <li><strong>Hobby Coding</strong> – Building personal tools, websites, and automations just for fun.</li>

      <h2>Tools I Use</h2>
      <p>
        My go-to stack includes <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>GDScript</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.  
        I build games in <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Godot</strong>, create UIs with <strong>Astro</strong> and <strong>Vue</strong>, and deploy everything on <strong>GitHub</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy using <strong>Blender</strong> for simple 3D assets and <strong>Flask</strong> for lightweight backends.
